Match shape instead of color, increase index into combos score by 2.
2 minute time limit to clear all gems.

if clear all gems in time, level up.
maybe multiple rounds of 7x5 grids as to see all blocks at beginning.
level difficulty:
	colors	shapes	columns	rows
	2	1	3	2
	1	2	3	2
	2	2	3	2
	2	2	5	3
	3	3	5	3
	3	3	6	4
	...	...	...	...
	5	5	7	5
HUD
	time
	score
matching shapes not required, except maybe to clear the board and maximize score.  match shape or color at any time.
time bonus does not end game.
having no moves left ends game.
like dimensions, hear sound when click to extend.  otherwise hear lower sound when contracting

idea:  draw a single line that matches adjacent by color or shape, but does not need to be consistent.
